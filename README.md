# 🌍 Established Remote Companies (Hiring Globally)

A curated list of **established remote / distributed / virtual tech companies** that hire **globally**.

The goal of this list is to highlight companies where:
- 🌱 **Established** = well-funded or profitable with **50+ employees**
- 💻 **Tech-focused** = more than a handful of software/data/engineering roles
- 🌐 **Global hiring** = not limited to a small set of high-income countries
- 💰 **Fair pay** = many offer globally competitive compensation

This list was originally started in 2015 to discover companies doing remote work *right*.  
Remote work went mainstream after 2020, so the focus is now on **companies that truly hire worldwide**.

> TL;DR — Remote work is awesome 🚀

Pull requests are welcome.  
Please keep the list **alphabetical**.
